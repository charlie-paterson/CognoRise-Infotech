Summary of Projects

1 - Car Price Prediciton
Using a car price prediction dataset, I built a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features within the dataset. Given the continuous nature of the target variable (price), I employed regression algorithms rather than classification models. The dataset contained numerous columns that could be feature-engineered to enhance the model's accuracy.

To optimize the feature selection process, I utilized a heatmap to analyze the correlations between the features and the target variable. This visual tool helped identify the most relevant features for training, ensuring that the final model was as accurate and effective as possible. By focusing on the most significant features, I aimed to improve the model's predictive performance and provide more precise car price estimations
