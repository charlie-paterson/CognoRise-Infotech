# Introduction to Projects

### 1 - Car Price Prediciton

Using a car price dataset, I built a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features within the dataset. Given the continuous nature of the target variable (price), I employed regression algorithms rather than classification models. The dataset contained numerous columns that could be feature-engineered to enhance the model's accuracy.

To optimize the feature selection process, I utilized a heatmap to analyze the correlations between the features and the target variable. This visual tool helped identify the most relevant features for training, ensuring that the final model was as accurate and effective as possible. By focusing on the most significant features, I aimed to improve the model's predictive performance and provide more precise car price estimations.


### 2 - Titanic Survival Prediciton

Using a Titanic survival dataset, which indicated whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, I built a machine learning model requiring classification algorithms for this project. To prepare the data for training, I cleaned and encoded it, converting all non-numeric data into numerical values, as machine learning models require integers and floats to process the information effectively.

Next, I performed feature engineering to enhance the predictive accuracy of the model. This involved creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones to better predict the survival chances of passengers. By carefully engineering these features, I aimed to improve the model's ability to distinguish between survivors and non-survivors more accurately.

To maximize the model's performance, I opted for a smaller test size, thereby increasing the training set's size. A larger training set provides the machine learning model with more data to learn from, enabling it to identify patterns more effectively. This approach ultimately contributed to a higher overall accuracy for the classification model, resulting in more reliable predictions of passenger survival based on the given dataset


### 3 - Fake News Detection 

The Fake News Prediction project aims to develop a sophisticated machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between genuine and fake news articles. This initiative addresses the growing concern of misinformation proliferating through various media channels, which can have significant societal and political impacts. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to provide a reliable and efficient tool for news verification, ultimately contributing to a more informed and discerning public.

Misinformation and fake news have become pervasive in the digital age, often leading to confusion, social unrest, and even political instability. The primary objective of this project is to mitigate these issues by developing a model that can identify fake news with high accuracy. This model will be beneficial for journalists, media companies, and the general public in verifying the authenticity of news articles.


### 4 - Iris Classification

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models to accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species based on four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is renowned not only for its simplicity and small size, making it an ideal candidate for beginners in machine learning, but also for its applicability in demonstrating the efficacy of various classification algorithms.

By the end of this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the classification process, from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and selection. This project not only reinforces fundamental concepts of machine learning but also equips us with practical skills necessary for tackling real-world classification problems.
