## Summary

The Iris Classification project aims to develop an accurate and reliable model for classifying Iris flowers into their respective species based on various features. By utilizing multiple machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to determine the most effective model for this classification task. The ultimate goal is to provide a tool that can classify Iris species with high precision, aiding botanists and researchers in their studies.

To achieve the highest accuracy in Iris classification, two different machine learning models were employed: Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting CLassifier. Each model was evaluated based on its accuracy score, a key metric that measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.

Logistic Regression Model

Accuracy Score: 100%
Performance: The Logistic Regression model achieved a perfect fit for the target variable, indicating that it correctly classified all Iris species based on the input features.
Random Forest Classifier Model

Accuracy Score: 99%
Performance: The Random Forest Classifier also performed exceptionally well, closely matching the accuracy of the Logistic Regression model. This ensemble method leveraged multiple decision trees to enhance predictive performance and robustness.
Support Vector Machine Model

Accuracy Score: 86%
Performance: The SVM model, while still producing a respectable score, lagged behind the other two models. Despite efforts to optimize its performance through grid search, it remained the lowest-performing model in this comparison
